    <h4>ACT I<br>
        Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
        Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with<br>
        ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
        columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of<br>
        stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
        should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to<br>
        ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
        mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which<br>
        clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
        duty as fatigued with their night's work</h4>
    <p>
        AP. My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I<br>
        did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm<br>
        quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've<br>
        a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad<br>
        to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this<br>
        fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best<br>
        substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing<br>
        at all like the real thing.
      
        [Fog clears away and discovers the scene described. Hurried<br>
        music. Mercury shoots up from behind precipice at the back of<br>
        stage. He carries several parcels afterwards described.  He sits<br>
        down, very much fatigued.]
      
        MER. Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.
      
        DIA. You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the<br>
        third time you've been out this week.<br>
      
        MER. Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.<br>
      
        DIA. I can't help being out all night.<br>
      
        MER. And I can't help being down all night. The nature of Mercury<br>
        requires that he should go down when the sun sets, and rise again<br>
        when the sun rises.<br>
      
        DIA. And what have you been doing?<br>
      
        MER. Stealing on commission. There's a set of false teeth and a<br>
        box of Life Pills for Jupiter—an invisible peruke and a bottle<br>
        of hair dye—that's for Apollo—a respirator and a pair of<br>
        galoshes—that's for Cupid—a full bottomed chignon, some<br>
        auricomous fluid, a box of pearl-powder, a pot of rouge, and a<br>
        hare's foot—that's for Venus.<br>
      
        DIA. Stealing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.<br>
      
        MER. Oh, as the god of thieves I must do something to justify my<br>
        position.<br>
      
        DIA.and AP. [contemptuously] Your position.<br>
      
        MER. Oh, I know it's nothing to boast of even on earth.  Up here,<br>
        it's simply contemptible.  Now that you gods are too old for your<br>
        work, you've made me the miserable drudge of Olympus—groom,<br>
        valet, postman, butler, commissionaire, maid of all work, parish<br>
        beadle, and original dustman.<br>
      
        AP. Your Christmas boxes ought to be something considerable.<br>
      
        MER. They ought to be but they're not.  I'm treated abominably.<br>
        I make everybody and I'm nobody.  I go everywhere and I'm<br>
        nowhere.  I do everything and I'm nothing.  I've made thunder for<br>
        Jupiter, odes for Apollo, battles for Mars, and love for Venus.<br>
        I've married couples for Humen and six weeks afterwards, I've<br>
        divorced them for Cupid, and in return I get all the kicks while<br>
        they pocket the halfpence. And in compensation for robbing me of<br>
        the halfpence in question, what have they done for me.<br>
      
        AP. Why they've—ha.ha.ha. they've made you the god of thieves.<br>
      
        MER. Very self denying of them.  There isn't one of them who<br>
        hasn't a better claim to the distinction than I have.<br>
      
             Oh, I'm the celestial drudge,<br>
             For morning to night I must stop at it.<br>
             On errands all day I must trudge,<br>
             And stick to my work til I drop at it.<br>
             In summer I get up at one.<br>
             (As a good-natured donkey I'm ranked for it.)<br>
             then I go and I light up the sun.<br>
             And Phoebus Apollo gets thanked for it.<br>
             Well, well, it's the way of the world.<br>
             And will be through all its futurity.<br>
             Though noodles are baroned and earled,<br>
             There's nothing for clever obscurity.<br>
      
             I'm the slave of the Gods, neck and heels,<br>
             And I'm bound to obey, though I rate at 'em.<br>
             And I not only order their meals,<br>
             But I cook 'em and serve'em and wait at 'em.<br>
             Then I make all their nectar, I do.<br>
             (What a terrible liquor to rack us is.)<br>
             And whenever I mix them a brew,<br>
             Why all the thanksgivings are Bacchus's.<br>
             Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc.....<br>
      
             The reading and writing I teach.<br>
             And spelling-books many I've edited.<br>
             And for bringing those arts within reach,<br>
             That donkey Minerva gets credited.<br>
             Then I scrape at the stars with a knife,<br>
             And plate-powder the moon (on the days for it).<br>
             And I hear all the world and his wife<br>
             Awarding Diana the praise for it.<br>
             Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc....<br>
      
        [After song—very loud and majestic music is heard]<br>
      
        DIA and MER [looking off] Why, who's this? Jupiter, by Jove.<br>
      
        [Enter Jupiter, an extremely old man, very decrepit, with very<br>
        thin straggling white beard, he wears a long braided dressing<br>
        gown, handsomely trimmed, and a silk night-cap on his head.<br>
        Mercury falls back respectfully as he enters.]<br>
      
        JUP. Good day, Diana.  Ah, Apollo.  Well, well, well, what's the<br>
        matter? What's the matter?<br>
    </p>
