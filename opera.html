        The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
        Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with<br>
        ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
        columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of<br>
        stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
        should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to<br>
        ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
        mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which<br>
        clears presently. Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
        duty as fatigued with their night's work.

        My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I<br>
        did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm<br>
        quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've<br>
        a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad<br>
        to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this<br>
        fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best<br>
        substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing<br>
        at all like the real thing.<br>
